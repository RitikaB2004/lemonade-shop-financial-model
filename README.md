# üçã Lemonade Stand Financial Modeling ‚Äì Review & Recap

## üìò Description
This repository contains a structured financial model for a small lemonade stand business, developed as part of a foundational review in financial modeling. It walks through the essential steps of building a model from scratch, including:
- Identifying product components and setup costs
- Estimating customer behavior and conversion rates
- Calculating unit economics (cost per cup)
- Accounting for waste and contingency
- Incorporating labor costs and setting a realistic selling price
- Applying basic modeling principles applicable across industries

The model emphasizes practical assumptions, bulk pricing, and realistic planning to simulate a small-scale business operation. Ideal for beginners in financial modeling or entrepreneurship.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the financial model file (Excel or PDF).
3. Review the assumptions and calculations.
4. Modify inputs to simulate different business scenarios.

## üìå Key Assumptions
- Bulk purchasing of ingredients to reduce cost per unit
- Estimated customer conversion rate based on foot traffic
- Waste factor included to account for spoilage
- Labor cost based on hourly wage and estimated hours
- Contingency buffer added to total cost

## üí∞ Unit Economics Summary
- Cost per cup of lemonade including ingredients and waste
- Total setup cost including equipment and initial inventory
- Break-even analysis based on selling price and volume

## üë∑ Labor & Pricing Strategy
- Labor cost is factored into the pricing model
- Selling price is set to ensure profitability while remaining competitive
- Pricing strategy considers customer willingness to pay and market conditions

## üìù Final Notes
This model serves as a practical introduction to financial modeling for small businesses. It can be adapted for other types of ventures and expanded with more advanced forecasting techniques.

Modeling a 
lemonade stand
The first steps in modeling
LECTURE SUMMARY
FINANCIAL 
MODELING
The first step in modeling anything is thinking about 
everything that‚Äôs involved in the business and making a 
list
1. What goes into the product? 
In order to make a lemonade you will need water, sugar, 
lemons, and ice 
2. How do you make the product? 
For making lemonade you will need a lemon juicer, and 
then you will need a pitcher and cups 
3. How do you deliver the product? 
In order to serve the lemonade, you need to have a table, 
a chair, an umbrella, a sign that gets customers‚Äô 
attention, and probably a cashbox 
See you next lecture!
You have to assume that not all people who walk by your 
stand are going to buy lemonade
You will need to keep track of: 
- how many people walk by 
- how many of them stop at your stand 
- how many of them actually end up buying

Unit economics (1)
How to calculate the cost per cup
LECTURE SUMMARY
FINANCIAL 
MODELING
The core metric of unit economics is the average cost of 
every cup of lemonade you serve - how much it cost to 
make it
You will need to do some research to find out a few basic 
things: 
- how many lemons does it take to make one cup of 
lemonade? 
- how much juice you can get out of a lemon? 
- how much ice do you put in a cup? 
- what‚Äôs the ratio for water, sugar, and lemons for one 
cup in order to get the best taste? 
Our assumptions are that the ratio is 1:1:1, a cup is 16oz, 
from which 4oz is ice, which means that we will need 4oz 
of water, 4oz of sugar, and 4oz of lemon juice 
See you next lecture!
Find out how much every ingredient costs if you buy it in 
bulk, then calculate the cost for 4oz
We assume that the juice of 2 lemons is enough for one 
cup of lemonade 
Calculate the cost of the napkins, cups, and straws 
You can finally add everything up and see how much it 
costs to make a cup of lemonade (in our example, $0.81)

Unit economics (2)
More costs involved
LECTURE SUMMARY
FINANCIAL 
MODELING
In order for your model to be realistic, you have to 
account for two more things when you calculate the cost 
per cup: waste and contingency
Waste is any of the product that you lose without 
recouping any payment for¬† 
In food & beverage, you inevitable lose a certain amount 
of your product because you can‚Äôt store it forever if it‚Äôs 
not sold 
Contingency means anything that can go wrong and 
will require an extra cost that is impossible to predict 
It‚Äôs best to plan for the worst

Calculating the labor cost
& selling price
How to include labor in your final price
LECTURE SUMMARY
FINANCIAL 
MODELING
Whether you hire someone or you do it all by yourself, 
you will have to include the cost of labor in your model, in 
order to set the final selling price of a cup
- Estimate how long it takes to make a batch of lemonade 
- Estimate how long it takes to sell that batch of 
lemonade 
- Estimate how many people walk by the area you‚Äôre 
targeting 
- Estimate what percentage of them will stop at your 
stand and what percentage of them will buy 
Calculating the cost of labor:
We assume that in a good location we can sell 40 cups 
per hour, for 5 hours a day (which means 200 cups/day), 
and it also takes 5 hours to make those 200 cups
See you next lecture!
Think about the amount of money you‚Äôd like to get for 
one hour of work¬†
If you want to get $30/hour, and you work for 10 hours a 
day, you need to get $300 in profits to make the whole 
business worth it
Add the unit cost for 200 cups ($0.89*200=$178) to the 
profit wanted ($178+$300=$478) and divide that by 200 
cups to get the price you need to sell a cup for 
($478/200=$2.39)
If you plan for the worst, round that up to $2.50 and 
that‚Äôs the final price you will ask for a cup

Jumpstart summary
The basics of modeling
LECTURE SUMMARY
FINANCIAL 
MODELING
All financial models, regardless of the industry, follow the 
same rough pattern:
- Think about the business 
- Research 
- Write down all the aspects worth analyzing 
- Make some educated assumptions 
The activity of financial modeling is just an activity of 
getting to know your business better and doing your best 
to understand the logistical and market dynamics that 
are going to affect you going forward
